# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Udacity Project

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. The process I did with the dataset is called data wrangling. I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

Feel free to comment on how I can improve more!
