After browsing for errors I then used pandas functions to easily check for errors that can't be seen by just looking at it. I made use of .head, .tail and .sample functions to check for inconsistencies. The .info and .describe to inspect the datatypes and values. I also checked for duplicates and nulls. I checked for inconsistencies with. After checking for the required quality issues I then check for tidiness issues. I used the guideline of \"each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, each observational unit forms a table\". After all that is done I moved to the next step."

    "After spotting all the issues, time to clean it up! First I made a copy of the data so I can always go back to the original if I did something wrong. Also, not everyone uses or will use the columns that I think I need. It is always better to make a copy instead of editing the original. I also followed the template of \"define, code and test\" in cleaning my data. I changed the datatypes of certain columns into their proper type. It may not be much but there are certain pandas functions that you can use to make your life easier so it is better to change their types now.I dropped the duplicates and null values as they won't help in the analysis phase. I changed the formatting of some columns so they can be better used for analysis. Some columns are merged into one to conform to the tidiness rules of data. Lastly, I merged them all into one table as I feel that they should be in one table instead of three."
